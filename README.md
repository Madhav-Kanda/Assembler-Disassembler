# Assembler-Disassembler

### Contributors: Saatvik Rao, Sahil Agrawal, Medhansh Singh, Madhav Kanda 

Our project consists of two parts. The first part involves implementing a MIPS assembler that takes assembly code as input and produces the corresponding machine code as output. The second part consists of implementing a MIPS disassembler by producing the MIPS assembly code corresponding to the machine code given as input by the user. This machine code need not be the previously assembled code.
#####
❖ Assembler: We have written a program to translate assembly language code to machine language code. The resulting machine code is in the same format as the input for our disassembler program, i.e., the output is a set of lines, each containing 32 bits of single machine instruction. 

❖ Disassembler: We have written a program that takes in strings representing a machine code and writes out the corresponding assembly language instructions.
